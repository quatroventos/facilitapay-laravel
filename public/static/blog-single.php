                  <p>Metaverse has been a hot topic of discussion since the last year when Facebook surprised the world after rebranding to Meta (a direct reference to the metaverse), and started to promote this “digital reality”. During an interview to The Verge, Mark Zuckerberg stated that the company would be shifting the focus from a social media platform to a “metaverse company” throughout the next five years.</p>
                  <p>A few months after Zuckerberg’s big news, Microsoft and Nvidia announced that they were working on their own metaverse and became loud voices in favor of this topic. Now, several companies are approaching the metaverse and thinking about how they can generate revenue from it. And, what is in the backbone of revenue generation? Payments! Payments are enablers for of monetization model and, in the metaverse, there are key challenges that need to be overcome. Thus, keep reading to discover this whole new world.</p>
                  <h5><strong>A very attractive market</strong></h5>
                  <p>Bloomberg has estimated that by 2024 the metaverse market may reach USD 783.3 billion, compared to USD 478.7 billion in 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 13.1%. Sounds appealing, right?</p>
                  <p>When we talk about the metaverse we are referring to a virtual world and, therefore, physical cash can’t be applied. Living in this world requires a proper virtual system to ensure all transactions, and digital payments are the main ways to sustain it.</p>
                  <p>Visa’s 2022 report – “The metaverse as a strategic inflection point”, points out that the metaverse has its own virtual economic system where users can trade and monetize digital content. There are built-in tools in these digital worlds as well as their own currencies, which can be cryptocurrencies in some platforms.</p>
                  <p>Some financial companies have already started making movements towards the metaverse. American Express, for example, has filled a trademark for tech to let people use its payments cards in virtual worlds. The company intends to provide card payments, ATM services, banking services and fraud detections for metaverse users.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, in August of the last year, Visa entered the metaverse after buying a USD 150,000 NFT (non-fungible-token). According to Forbes, “if the metaverse merchants are bound to transform the economy, Visa sees its role in being the engine of that revolution.” As we can see, financial institutions are becoming attracted by the metaverse. Yet, not only them, but any other business in this virtual world will need to adapt its revenue generation strategy. How? Through digital payments.</p>
                  <h5><strong>Blockchain and digital payments</strong></h5>
                  <p>Blockchain technology is one of the main foundations of the metaverse. If you don’t believe it, remember that it is a highly safe and inclusive transaction way. It also enables users to trade without the supervision from regulatory bodies, governments or other organizations.</p>
                  <p>Besides its high level of security, blockchain enables instant payments and, with crypto payments, favors the settlement of digital assets such as NFTs and cryptocurrencies.</p>
